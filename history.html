                     <h2>Episode 1: Adventure</h2>
                     <p> The story begins in a small town, fortified by cobblestone walls & kept safe by the Militia. Tyler 
                      enjoyed luxury in a small castle, previously his brother's who was a high ranking Militia official before 
                      he disappeared. One day Tyler stumbled upon Granny Bacon's secret underground base, & that's when this 
                      adventure truly began. Bacon was apart of the Rebels, who are working to overthrow the now tyranical Militia & 
                      uncover Ozai's ulterior motives. Tyler finds out Ryan disappeared after coming close to learning the truth, & joins Samantha
                      in order to find the truth.
                      His involvement & Militia framing him for a warehouse explosion makes him enemy number one. He also stumbles across ruins that has
                      a seemingly useless staff. The Militia catch wind of the Rebels base of operations and
                      blow up the Port City which Tyler/Samantha survive by hiding in the fountain. After building the new Tree Fortress
                      Rebel Base in the port's ruins, Samantha finds out they're looking for something called an Earth 
                      Element. Tyler & Billy was tasked to finding out more...  </p>

                   <p>Tyler/Billy begin their search for the Earth Element, at an ancient Dwarven City called Stoneholm.
                      The city is closed off to outsiders & has been on lockdown for years.
                      The reason for the lockdown is the Dwarven King has built a machine that can break through bedrock, finding 
                      a deep hidden core underneath the city. They sneak in and search the city. There they meet Baldwuf, revealed to be an elemental bender. Tyler takes the 
                      Earth Element before he can, & escapes. Back at the town, Ben asks to come on their journey & Tyler welcomes him.
                      He also finds out Juno is the Water Bender, who gives him the water tablet. Tyler meets a mysterious figure called Val 
                      Petri, who tells him about a dangerous dungeon that he needs to explore. Tyler & Billy trek across an ancient ruin that has them making 
                      leaps of faith across the void itself, a seemingly endless pit of emptiness that resides beneath the bedrock. At the end they find a pile 
                      of Ender Pearls, which Tyler buries underneath his home for safe keeping.</p>

          Tyler in the Nether by locking the gate to the portal.
          
          Tyler is trapped in the Nether for months until he stumbles upon a pigmen village, where Ryan 
          had been for 60 years. This occured over 400 years ago in pigmen time, although this is not 
          even 2 years in regular time. The pigmen help Tyler escape through a second portal, the one which Ryan used.
