        <p> Rebel Scouts have discovered a sizable Militia base in Northern Agar which Tyler and Billy infiltrate the

          Billy and Tyler discover the Militia's Nether facility where the 
          Militia are draining the lava to find the Fire Element. Tyler goes in Ozai's room and discovers he and Ryan had battled 
          here a couple years ago, and Ozai had left Ryan trapped in the Nether. A Lava Monster emerges and 
          after Tyler defeats it, the Fire Element is dropped. Unfortunately it is retrieved by Ozai, who traps 
          Tyler in the Nether by locking the gate to the portal.
          
          Tyler is trapped in the Nether for months until he stumbles upon a pigmen village, where Ryan 
          had been for 60 years. This occured over 400 years ago in pigmen time, although this is not 
          even 2 years in regular time. The pigmen help Tyler escape through a second portal, the one which Ryan used.

        <h2>Episode 14: Final Flash</h2>
        <p> Tyler finds himself in Val Petri's 2nd flashback where it recalls a younger Tyler/Ryan gathering supplies for their airship.
            Younger Tyler stumbles upon the basement of his childhood home where he finds out one of his parents was the Air Bender and learns 
            about how the Elemental powers work. When Ryan and Tyler leave on their airship they crash in the desert. The dream ends as they struggle 
            to get out, as Val Petri warns that Ozai is in the End, which caused some of the End to leak onto the overworld. 

            Tyler and Monkey go to the End leakage and battle the Dark Apostle. Monkey sustains heavy injuries but they close the portal. 
            Immediately after the battle Tyler is taken to the final flashback, a battle between the Rebels and the Militia from Ryan's POV. It 
            shows the Rebels driving Ozai and the Militia away, allowing the Rebels to find a dungeon. Inside is the Staff of Val Petri, which 
            Ryan takes. The episode ends with Tyler and Ryan reuniting.

        <p> Monkey rides off to tend to his injuries, not before Ryan tells him he must "find the other side of the world". Ryan and Tyler 
            torwards the End Portal which is being guarded by the Earth Bender who wants their Ender Pearls and Elements to get into the End.
            Tyler is almost killed by the Earth Bender until he activates his Elemental state and destroys the Earth Bender. He absorbs Earth 
            Bending into his bloodline and ventures inside The End with Ryan. There he battles Ozai, who he defeats by making the Fire Bender fall
            into the void. They get to the Dark Prophet and find out he has already been awakened and will return to the overworld in 30 years. 
            But they are able to bring back three souls and they revive Ben, Arnold, and Samantha. 
            To escape The End they must defeat the Ender Dragon. Tyler and Ryan look at each other one last time before plunging into the portal,
            unaware of what awaits them on the other side.
