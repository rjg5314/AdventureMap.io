                     <h2>Episode 1: Adventure</h2>
                     <p> The story begins in a small town, fortified by cobblestone walls and kept safe by the Militia. Tyler 
                      enjoyed luxury in a small castle, previously his brother's who was a high ranking Militia official before 
                      he disappeared. One day Tyler stumbled upon Granny Bacon's secret underground base, and that's when this 
                      adventure truly began. Bacon was apart of the Rebels, who are working to overthrow the now tyranical Militia and 
                      uncover Ozai's ulterior motives. Tyler finds out Ryan disappeared after coming close to learning the truth, and joins Samantha
                      in order to find the truth.
                      His involvement and Militia framing him for a warehouse explosion makes him enemy number one. He also stumbles across ruins that has
                      a seemingly useless staff. The Militia catch wind of the Rebels base of operations and
                      blow up the Port City which Tyler/Samantha survive by hiding in the fountain. After building the new Tree Fortress
                      Rebel Base in the port's ruins, Samantha finds out they're looking for something called an Earth 
                      Element. Tyler and Billy was tasked to finding out more...  </p>

                   <h2>Episode 2: Into the Void</h2>
                   <p> Tyler/Billy begin their search for the Earth Element, and find a tablet in the library that points 
                      to an ancient Dwarven City called Stoneholm. After given a lift by the Steampunk Crew, they arrive to find a city in dismay.
                      The city is closed off to outsiders and has been on lockdown for years, which forces the duo to sneak in.
                      The reason for the lockdown is the Dwarven King has built a machine that can break through the previously unbreakable bedrock, finding 
                      a deep hidden core underneath the city. There they meet Baldwuf, revealed to be an elemental bender. Tyler takes the 
                      Earth Element before he can, and escapes. Back at the town, Ben asks to help him on their journey and Tyler welcomes him aboard the next voyage.
                      He also finds out Juno is the Water Bender, who gives himm the water tablet whichh she needs translated. Tyler meets a mysterious figure called Val 
                      Petri, who tells him about a dangerous dungeon that he needs to explore. Tyler and Billy trek across an ancient ruin that has them making 
                      leaps of faith across the void itself, a seemingly endless pit of emptiness that resides beneath the bedrock. At the end they find a pile 
                      of Ender Pearls, which Tyler buries underneath his home for safe keeping.</p>

                    to the Militia and gotten him arrested. The crew go to free Sully from this "secret" cell to find the ground disappear underneath their feet. 
                    Margaret had lead them into a trap, devised by Ozai and the Earth Bender who were working together. They take the Earth Element from Tyler, but don't find the hidden 
                    Ender Pearls. The three are sent to a Militia prison, where all the Militia's enemies are thrown. One of which being Solomon who 
                    tells them more about the Militia. About how they go from town to town offering protection and eventually take it over. They weren't a 
                    small military force gone rogue, turns out they were a massive operation. Tyler figures out Ozai is the Fire Bender. 
                    They find Sully and they all work together to start a prison riot and break out of jail. Solomon dies during the riot and 
                    Sully says he'll stay behind to make sure the rest of the freed prisoners make it to safety. Tyler, Billy, and Ben

          had been for 60 years. This occured over 400 years ago in pigmen time, although this is not

        <p> Tyler finds himself in Val Petri's 2nd flashback where it recalls a younger Tyler/Ryan gathering supplies for their airship.
            Younger Tyler stumbles upon the basement of his childhood home where he finds out one of his parents was the Air Bender and learns 
            about how the Elemental powers work. When Ryan and Tyler leave on their airship they crash in the desert. The dream ends as they struggle
